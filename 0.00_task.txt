1) Example for below topics both in C++ and python.
    OOP:
    1) Class
    2) Object
    3) Methods
    4) Inheritance
    5) Encapsulation
    6) Polymorphism
    7) Abstraction

2) abstract vs interface:
        Abstract class:
            - Can have shared code (some methods with implementations).
            - Used for related classes.
            - Inherited using `extends`.
            - Example: Think of it as a blueprint for a house that provides some common features (like walls and roof) but leaves some details (like interior design) for the specific house to define.
        Interface:
            - Cannot have any code (only method signatures).
            - Used for unrelated classes.
            - Implemented using `implements`.
            - Example: Think of it as a contract that specifies what needs to be done (like having a door and windows) but not how to do it. Each class that implements the interface decides how to fulfill these requirements.

                    Abstract Class:          Interface:
                     _________               _________
                    |  Shape  |             |  Shape  |
                    |_________|             |_________|
                        /_\                     /_\                   
                       /   \...extends...      /   \...implements...              
                     _________               _________
                    |  Circle |             |  Circle |
                    |_________|             |_________|
                     _________               _________
                    |Rectangle|             |Rectangle|
                    |_________|             |_________|


3) virtual keyword in C++: Used in base classes to allow derived classes to override a method, ensuring the correct method is called based on the object type at runtime.
